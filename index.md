## Opening Remarks

Arm's Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) has arrived, but what does SVE mean for typical high performance computing workloads and how do you use it? This hands-on, non-NDA event will present SVE and show how common HPC codes can be recompiled to take advantage of large vector lengths without code modifications.

## Presentations

Short presentations from community members, SVE tool developers, application teams, and hardware developers to introduce core concepts and lay the roadmap for future SVE applications.

## Hands-on with SVE

The entirely hands-on afternoon session will introduce the Arm's tools for SVE developers and show how to generate SVE-enabled binaries targeting popular vector lengths. The session will include contributions from people who are running and porting applications for SVE.
